# Gen-AI-Chatbot-Builder
Build 2 uses(2 domains) of Chat Bot using Gen AI, AI, NLP.
The Bot backend should be able to work with OpenAI as well opensource LLMs.
Admin should be able to design the flow of chatbot interaction using visual workflow library.
There should provision to add different data source like FAQs, website, pdfs, , crm, excel etc.. as knowledge base for bot to service the customer.
This will be a fixed bid project, hence quote your fixed bid price. Bids without a fixed bid price will be given low priority.
Channels : responsive web chatbot and whatsapp, voice and IVR channels
There options to define the Domain and tune the LLM to answer domain specific terminologies

Phase 2:
Use LLM to take flow as natural language and build the workflow accordingly
----------------
Building a chatbot backend system that works with both OpenAI's API and open-source LLMs, with visual workflow design, knowledge base integration, and domain-specific tuning, is a comprehensive and sophisticated project. Below is a high-level Python-based design for such a system, incorporating major features like chatbot interaction, workflow design, domain-specific knowledge management, and multi-channel integration (Web, WhatsApp, IVR, etc.).
Solution Breakdown

    Backend:
        Integration with OpenAI and Open-Source LLMs: The system should be flexible enough to use either OpenAI or an open-source LLM for the chatbot's conversational engine. We can use libraries like Transformers for open-source models.
        Knowledge Base Integration: The bot should be able to ingest data from multiple sources (FAQs, websites, PDFs, CRM, Excel, etc.) and use this as a knowledge base to respond accurately to customer queries.
        Domain-Specific Tuning: The bot should be able to understand and adapt to specific domain terminology, ensuring it provides relevant responses in a given context.
        Multi-Channel Support: The bot should be able to interact across multiple channels like web chat, WhatsApp, voice, and IVR.

    Admin Dashboard:
        Visual Workflow Designer: An admin panel that allows users to design chatbot conversation flows visually, specifying user inputs, bot responses, and decision points.
        Knowledge Base Configuration: Admins should be able to add, modify, or delete knowledge sources (e.g., FAQs, CRM, etc.).

    Phase 2:
        Natural Language Workflow Creation: Use LLMs to interpret natural language descriptions and create a workflow automatically based on those inputs.

Python Framework

We will use various libraries for implementing the bot and the admin dashboard, such as:

    FastAPI: For the backend API service.
    Langchain: For orchestrating LLMs and workflows.
    Transformers: For open-source models like GPT-2, GPT-Neo, or other LLMs.
    Rasa: For building chatbot logic and custom workflows.
    Flask/Dash: For creating an admin dashboard.
    Twilio API: For WhatsApp integration.
    Voicebot integration: Use a service like Twilio IVR for voice bots.

High-Level Architecture

    Backend API Service (FastAPI):
        Acts as the central point of communication between the chatbot, external sources, and the front-end application (web, WhatsApp, IVR).

    Bot Engine (Langchain + Transformers/OpenAI):
        This module integrates with OpenAI API and open-source LLMs (like GPT-2, GPT-Neo) for processing the chatbot's responses.

    Admin Dashboard (Flask/Dash):
        The admin can design workflows and manage the knowledge base using a visual workflow designer. Data can be added manually or through integrations.

    Multi-Channel Integration:
        Web Chat: Embed the chatbot on a web page.
        WhatsApp: Use the Twilio API to handle WhatsApp interactions.
        IVR (Voicebot): Use Twilio or another voice solution to create a phone-based interaction system.

    Knowledge Base Integration:
        Integrate with various data sources (FAQs, PDFs, CRM, etc.). This can be done using an embedding-based retrieval system (like FAISS or Haystack) to allow the chatbot to search through structured and unstructured data.

Python Code: Basic Framework

Below is a simplified example of a chatbot backend that integrates with OpenAI and open-source LLMs, along with basic knowledge base integration.

import openai
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# FastAPI app initialization
app = FastAPI()

# OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

# Open-source GPT model initialization (GPT-2 in this case)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Langchain setup for OpenAI integration
llm_openai = OpenAI(openai_api_key=openai.api_key)

# Knowledge Base (For simplicity, let's use a basic FAQ system)
knowledge_base = {
    "What is your return policy?": "You can return items within 30 days.",
    "What are your working hours?": "We are open from 9 AM to 6 PM, Monday to Friday."
}

@app.get("/ask_openai/{query}")
async def ask_openai(query: str):
    """Function to interact with OpenAI API"""
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=query,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return {"response": response.choices[0].text.strip()}

@app.get("/ask_open_source/{query}")
async def ask_open_source(query: str):
    """Function to interact with Open Source GPT (GPT-2 here)"""
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(query, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=150)
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return {"response": response.strip()}

@app.get("/ask_knowledge_base/{query}")
async def ask_knowledge_base(query: str):
    """Simple FAQ-based knowledge base query"""
    response = knowledge_base.get(query, "Sorry, I don't have an answer to that question.")
    return {"response": response}

@app.post("/train_workflow/")
async def train_workflow(flow_description: str):
    """Function to train a chatbot workflow based on natural language description"""
    # Use Langchain for workflow creation (expand as per requirements)
    prompt = f"Create a chatbot flow based on the following description: {flow_description}"
    chain = LLMChain(llm_openai, PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt))
    flow = chain.run(flow_description)
    return {"workflow": flow}

Detailed Explanation:

    API Endpoints:
        /ask_openai/{query}: Uses OpenAI's API to generate responses based on the user's query.
        /ask_open_source/{query}: Uses GPT-2, an open-source LLM, to generate responses.
        /ask_knowledge_base/{query}: A simple FAQ knowledge base lookup (this could be expanded into more complex integrations).
        /train_workflow/: This endpoint can be used to train or create workflows based on natural language descriptions. You can extend this to generate complex workflows using LangChain and other tools.

    Langchain: Langchain is a flexible framework that can connect different LLMs, APIs, and workflows. In the above example, we use it to generate chatbot workflows based on a natural language description.

    Knowledge Base: The chatbot can retrieve answers from a predefined FAQ. This can be expanded to work with external data sources like CRM, PDFs, and Excel files by integrating a more robust retrieval mechanism (e.g., FAISS or Haystack).

Admin Dashboard (Flask/Dash):

For the Admin Dashboard to manage the flow and knowledge base, you can use a library like Dash for Python, which provides easy-to-use components for creating interactive web applications. Here’s an outline for the admin interface:

import dash
from dash import html, dcc
import dash_core_components as dcc

# Initialize Dash app
app = dash.Dash(__name__)

# Basic Layout with a flow designer (using dcc components)
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H1('Chatbot Admin Dashboard'),
    html.Div([
        html.H3('Design Chatbot Flow:'),
        dcc.Textarea(id='flow_input', placeholder="Enter chatbot flow description here...", style={'width': '100%', 'height': 200}),
        html.Button('Generate Flow', id='generate_flow_btn'),
        html.Div(id='generated_flow_output')
    ])
])

# Callback for generating the workflow
@app.callback(
    dash.dependencies.Output('generated_flow_output', 'children'),
    [dash.dependencies.Input('generate_flow_btn', 'n_clicks')],
    [dash.dependencies.State('flow_input', 'value')]
)
def generate_workflow(n_clicks, value):
    if n_clicks > 0 and value:
        # Call the backend API to generate the workflow
        response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/train_workflow/', json={"flow_description": value})
        return f"Generated Flow: {response.json()['workflow']}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)

Conclusion and Phase 2:

This is a high-level architecture and initial framework for building the chatbot backend with multi-channel integration, visual workflow design, and knowledge base management. The bot integrates with OpenAI and open-source models (like GPT-2) and can be extended to support more complex workflows and advanced knowledge retrieval methods. In Phase 2, we would focus on enabling natural language flow creation, where users can describe workflows in natural language, and the system would automatically generate a process.
